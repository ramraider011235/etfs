description,"The fund utilizes a ""fund of funds"" structure to invest in sector-based equity ETFs. It seeks to achieve its objective through dynamic sector rotation. The Adviser focuses its research primarily on sector selection by carefully reviewing the sectors, industries, and sub-industries in the fund's portfolio. The Adviser chooses sectors it believes are undervalued and poised to respond favorably to financial market catalysts. The fund sells a security when it achieves its target price and is, in the opinion of the Adviser, no longer undervalued."
