description,"The fund will invest in companies of all sizes, with increased exposure to smaller capitalization, lower relative price, and higher profitability companies as compared to their representation in the U.S. Universe. As a non-fundamental policy, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of U.S. companies. The Advisor may also increase or reduce the fund's exposure to an eligible company, or exclude a company, based on shorter-term considerations, such as a company's price momentum and investment characteristics."
