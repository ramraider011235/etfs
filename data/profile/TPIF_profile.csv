description,"The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets directly or indirectly in the securities included in the Victory International Volatility Weighted BRI Index, an unmanaged, volatility weighted index created by the Sub-Advisor. The index combines fundamental criteria with individual security risk control achieved through volatility weighting of individual securities, rather than traditional market cap weighting."
