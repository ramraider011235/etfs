description,"The fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the components of the index. It is a “fund of funds,” meaning that it invests its assets in the common shares of funds included in the index rather than in individual securities. The index is designed to measure the overall performance of a universe of U.S.-listed closed-end funds that are organized under the laws of the United States and are principally engaged in asset management processes designed to produce taxable annual yield."
