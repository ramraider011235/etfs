description,"The fund is an actively managed ETF and thus does not seek to replicate the performance of a specific index. Instead, it uses an active management strategy to meet its investment objective. The fund, under normal circumstances, invests at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from federal income tax (""Municipal Bonds""). It does not intend to invest in Municipal Bonds whose interest is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax."
