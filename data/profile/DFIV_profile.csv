description,"The Advisor buys and sells securities for the Portfolio with the goals of: (i) delaying and minimizing the realization of net capital gains (e.g., selling stocks with capital losses to offset gains, realized or anticipated); and (ii) maximizing the extent to which any realized net capital gains are long-term in nature (i.e., taxable at lower capital gains tax rates). The fund is designed to generally purchase securities of large non-U.S. companies in countries with developed markets that the Advisor determines to be lower relative price stocks."
