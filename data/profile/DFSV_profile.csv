description,"The portfolio, using a market capitalization weighted approach, is designed to purchase a broad and diverse group of the readily marketable securities of U.S. small cap companies that the Advisor determines to be value stocks. Under a market capitalization weighted approach, companies with higher market capitalizations generally represent a larger proportion of the portfolio than companies with relatively lower market capitalizations. As a non-fundamental policy, under normal circumstances, the portfolio will invest at least 80% of its net assets in securities of small cap U.S. companies."
