It normally invests at least 80% of its assets in equity securities. Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest significantly in issuers domiciled outside the United States (i.e., at least 40% of its net assets, unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the fundâ€™s investment adviser, in which case the fund would invest at least 30% of its net assets in issuers domiciled outside the United States). It is non-diversified."
