description,"The fund is a ""fund of funds,"" meaning that it primarily invests its assets in securities of other exchange-traded funds (""ETFs""). In particular, it allocates its assets among ETFs that each focus on common stocks of companies included in an individual sector of the S&P 500® Index, as determined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®). Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of borrowings for investments purposes) directly or indirectly through the underlying ETFs, in securities of U.S. companies."
