description,"The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in the equity securities that comprise the index. The index seeks to provide opportunistic investment exposure to those stocks with the potential to ""break out,"" or experience a period of sustained price growth beyond the stock's recent ""resistance level,"" with consideration for various market conditions. The fund is non-diversified."
