description,"The fund normally invests in securities comprising the index. The index generally consists of 18 exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and 50 U.S. exchange-listed stocks (the “Equity Portfolio Sleeve”), though this may change from time to time. It may invest up to 20% of its assets in investments that are not included in the index, but that the Adviser believes will help the fund track the performance of the index."
