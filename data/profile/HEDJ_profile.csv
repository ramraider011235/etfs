description,"The fund invests at least 95% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in component securities of the index and investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of such component securities. The index provides exposure to European equity securities, particularly shares of European exporters, while at the same time neutralizing exposure to fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar and the euro. The fund is non-diversified."
