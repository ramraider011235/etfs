description,"The Adviser employs a multi-step, quantitative, rules-based methodology to identify a portfolio of approximately 50 to 100 undervalued U.S. equity securities with the potential for capital appreciation. A security is considered to be undervalued when it trades at a price below the price at which the Adviser believes it would trade if the market reflected all factors relating to the companyâ€™s worth. The fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets in cash and cash equivalents, other investment companies, as well as securities and other instruments."
